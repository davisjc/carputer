# Sync music state with the carputer transport device.
#
# This script does a few things:
#
#     1. Updates the transport device with current metadata of source system.
#        This will tell the carputer if there are any stale files it ought to
#        delete.
#
#     2. Reads the list of last known music metadata of the carputer from the
#        transport device. This allows us to know what versions of what music
#        files should currently exist on the carputer.
#
#     3. Copies new music files to the transport device.
#
#     4. TODO copy mpd library?
